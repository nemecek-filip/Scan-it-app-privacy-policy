# Scan it app: Privacy policy

_This is temporary place for privacy policy until I set up my personal site._

Privacy policy for **Scan it** is pretty straightforward. The app does not collect any data _at all_. There is not analytics code, no tracking, nada.

App does not contain any 3rd party code. All the items user scans are saved locally on the device and uploaded once to the iCloud Drive where user can access them.
